Angela Y. Lee is a Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University in the [Department of Communication]([url](https://comm.stanford.edu/)). She studies Media Psychology as part of the [Stanford Social Media Lab]([url](https://sml.stanford.edu/)), where she is advised by [Dr. Jeffrey Hancock]([url](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fU4Y4fEAAAAJ)). Her work is supported by the Stanford Interdisciplinary Graduate Fellowship, the Stanford Social Impact Labs, and the Haas Center's Fellowship for Public Service. Her research has been published in top venues such as the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, Communication Research, New Media + Society, PNAS Nexus, and the Proceedings of the ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing (CSCW). 

She studies the power of people’s beliefs about communication technology. Her research program integrates theories from media psychology and social cognition to investigate how people interpret their experiences with mediated communication, and to examine how these beliefs affect downstream psychological, interpersonal, and behavioral processes. She focuses on identifying novel theoretical mechanisms that explain when, why, and for whom digital experiences can be beneficial or harmful, and develops theoretically-driven interventions to improve these outcomes. 

Her program of research investigates the importance of people’s beliefs about technology in three domains: 1) psychological well-being and mental health, 2) misinformation and resilience to digital threats, and 3) trust in human-AI interactions and communication. To advance these lines of inquiry, she develops and validates novel survey measures, conducts rigorous laboratory and field experiments, and executes longitudinal studies including randomized controlled trials and large-scale, multi-wave panels. She grounds this quantitative research in qualitative interview methods and community-centric partnerships with non-profit organizations representing the communities she works with. 

She obtained her M.A. degree and dual B.A. degrees in Psychology and Communication from Stanford University. Outside of academia, she has worked with non-profit organizatons dedicated to supporting youth well-being, online and offline, ([My Digital Tat2](https://www.mydigitaltat2.org/)) and caring for individuals and families living with mental illness ([National Alliance for Mental Illness](namisf.org)).
